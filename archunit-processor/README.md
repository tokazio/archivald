# Archivald - ArchUnit processor

Private module that provide the ArchUnit implementation of an Archivald processor to be used over

* KSP
* Java Annotation processor (TODO)

This is not providing ArchUnit transitively allowing the use of another (maybe incompatible) archUnit version, maybe it
should ?
