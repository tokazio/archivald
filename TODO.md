# TODO

* solution to ignore some rules (from src/rules or external jars)
* logs to a file
* better handling of multiple failed rules (like a report ?)
* @ArchitectureRule(level) error (break the build) or warn
* max number of errors in no fail fast mode
* do not recompile src/rules file if not changed
